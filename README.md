MarioKart
=========

This is a 1.13+ fork of the official repo for the MarioKart plugin by storm345 and stormdev

The 1.16+-branch enables custom Minecart-Models!    
The dev-branch is based on the 1.16+-branch!

WILL ONLY WORK WITH UCARS 1.13+ (v1.5 following)!  
(Fork for that: [uCars 1.13+](https://github.com/Jakllp/ucars))  
Also: Please use ucars-1.12 for MK-1.12.

## Other requirements:
### Up to v1.5.0:
- COAL_BLOCK needs to be road block when using road blocks (when using powerups)

### Up to v1.5.1:
- [BarAPI](https://github.com/confuser/BarAPI) is necessary for some features (there will be errors otherwise)
- BarAPI has been implemented directly into MarioKart as of v1.5.1 under the [CC-Non-Commercial-License](https://github.com/confuser/BarAPI/blob/master/licence.txt)
